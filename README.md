Server Density v1 Agent Plugins
===

These plugins are for the old Server Density agent v1. [Plugins for the v2 agent are in the sd-agent-core-plugins repo](https://github.com/serverdensity/sd-agent-core-plugins/).

See [information about v1 custom plugins](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001083186) to see how to install, configure & troubleshoot custom plugins with the v1 agent.

Whilst still supported, we encourage customers to use our v2 agent and to update or create any new custom plugins in the v2 custom plugin format.

See [information about v2 custom plugins](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001082746) to see how to install, configure & troubleshoot custom plugins with the v2 agent.
